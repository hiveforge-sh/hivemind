# The Age of Shadows

## Description

A legendary period of darkness and cold that lasted a generation, occurring approximately 8,000 years before the current era. During this time, the Frozen Ones descended from the far north, bringing death and an endless winter.

## In-World Knowledge

Ancient texts and oral traditions describe a winter that lasted a generation. The sun hid its face for years, and children were born and grew old in darkness. The Frozen Ones and their armies of the dead swept across the land, nearly destroying all life.

The Age of Shadows ended when the last hero, wielding a blade of starforged steel, led the First Folk and the Forest Children against the Frozen Ones in the War for the Dawn.

## Historical Impact

- **The Frostwall**: Built after the Age of Shadows to guard against future invasions
- **The Watchers**: Founded to man the Frostwall and watch for the return of the threat
- **Frosthold**: House Northwind established as guardians of the North
- **Pact with the Forest Children**: Alliance between First Folk and Forest Children

## Out-of-World Notes

The Age of Shadows is central to the mythology of Everheim. Many believe it may recur, giving weight to the Northwind words "Winter Endures."

## Scholarly Debate
