# Tidewatch

Tidewatch is a prosperous coastal city known for its magical academy and thriving merchant harbor. The city sits at the confluence of the Starfall River and the Sapphire Sea, giving it strategic importance for both trade and defense.

### Academy Quarter
Home to [[The Arcane Academy]], this district is filled with magical shops, libraries, and student housing.

### Old Town

## History

Founded over 500 years ago as a fishing village, Tidewatch grew rapidly after the discovery of a natural deepwater harbor. The construction of [[The Arcane Academy]] 200 years ago transformed it into a center of magical learning.

## Current Events

The city is currently facing threats from the [[Shadow Court]], who seek to open the ancient portal to the [[Shadowfell]] hidden beneath the city.
