# Enterprise Buyer Persona

## Overview

**"The Approval Navigator"**

Enterprise Buyers are procurement specialists at large companies who need to balance efficiency with compliance. They want to move fast but are constrained by approval workflows, budget limits, and audit requirements.

## Demographics

- **Company size**: 500+ employees
- **Role**: Procurement, Office Manager, Operations
- **Purchase authority**: Limited (typically <$500 without approval)
- **Order frequency**: 2-5 orders per week
- **Average order**: $800-2,000

## Goals

1. Complete purchases efficiently within company policies
2. Get approvals quickly without endless back-and-forth
3. Maintain audit trail for finance team
4. Consolidate orders to reduce shipping costs

## Frustrations

1. **Mobile app doesn't support approval workflows** — forced to switch to desktop
2. **Cannot share carts with approvers** — resorts to screenshots
3. **Receipt format doesn't meet requirements** — manual reformatting
4. **Information not saved** — re-entering addresses and payment methods

## Typical Day

> "I check our inventory levels on my phone during my morning commute. If we need supplies, I'll browse and add things to my cart. But when I get to the office, I have to switch to my laptop to actually complete the purchase because I need my manager's approval for anything over $500. I usually batch things together to make it worth the approval hassle."

## Key Quote

> "I need to get approval before I can complete any purchase over $500. The app just doesn't support that."
