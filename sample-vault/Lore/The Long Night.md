# The Long Night

## Description

A legendary period of darkness and cold that lasted a generation, occurring approximately 8,000 years before the events of the current era. During this time, the White Walkers descended from the far north, bringing death and an endless winter.

## In-World Knowledge

Ancient texts and oral traditions describe a winter that lasted a generation. The sun hid its face for years, and children were born and grew old in darkness. The White Walkers and their armies of the dead swept across the land, nearly destroying all life.

The Long Night ended when the last hero, wielding a blade of dragonsteel, led the First Men and the Children of the Forest against the White Walkers in the War for the Dawn.

## Historical Impact

- **The Wall**: Built after the Long Night to guard against future invasions
- **Night's Watch**: Founded to man the Wall and watch for the return of the threat
- **Winterfell**: House Stark established as guardians of the North
- **Pact with the Children**: Alliance between First Men and Children of the Forest

## Out-of-World Notes

The Long Night is central to the mythology of Westeros. Many believe it may recur, giving weight to the Stark words "Winter is Coming."

## Scholarly Debate

Maesters dispute whether the Long Night was a single event or multiple periods of extended winter conflated into legend. The existence of White Walkers is often dismissed as myth by southerners.
