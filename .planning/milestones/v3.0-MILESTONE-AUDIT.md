**No orphaned exports. No missing connections. No broken wiring.**

## E2E Flow Verification (4/4 complete)

### Flow 1: New User Setup
`npx hivemind init` → config.json → `npx hivemind validate` → `npx hivemind fix --apply` → Obsidian commands
**Status:** Complete. Config flows end-to-end.

### Flow 2: CLI Validation
`npx hivemind validate` → see issues → `npx hivemind fix` → preview → `--apply`
**Status:** Complete. Scanner reused, issue types map to fix operations.

### Flow 3: Obsidian Commands
Ctrl+P → Add/Validate/Fix frontmatter → sidebar panel → context menus
**Status:** Complete. All commands wired with modals and feedback.

### Flow 4: Folder Mapping
Config defines mappings → validate uses them → fix uses them → Obsidian uses them
**Status:** Complete. Single FolderMapper shared across all consumers.

## Tech Debt (2 items, non-critical)

**Phase 16 - Obsidian Commands:**
1. Hardcoded `FRONTMATTER_TEMPLATES` in plugin (lines 45-165) duplicates template registry schema data. Works correctly but creates maintenance burden if templates change.
2. Template registry initialization differs between CLI (per-command) and plugin (on-load). Both work, but pattern inconsistency.

## Test Coverage

| Phase | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 12 - Setup Wizard | Human verified (12-04) | All passing |
| 13 - Folder Mapping | 48 tests | All passing |
| 14 - Validate CLI | 77 tests | All passing |
| 15 - Fix CLI | 46 tests | All passing |
| 16 - Obsidian Commands | Human verified (16-04) + build passes | All passing |
| **Total suite** | **502 tests** | **All passing** |
