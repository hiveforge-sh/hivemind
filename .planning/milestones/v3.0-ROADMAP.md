# Milestone v3.0: Developer Experience

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-27
**Phases:** 12-16
**Total Plans:** 19

## Overview

Make Hivemind easy to set up and use — new users productive in minutes, existing vault owners can bulk-convert their markdown files.

## Phases

### Phase 12: Setup Wizard

**Goal**: New users can initialize Hivemind with a single command and get productive immediately
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of milestone)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Install dependencies and create shared CLI utilities
- [x] 12-02: Create core wizard with prompts and template selection
- [x] 12-03: Config generation, output, and non-interactive mode
- [x] 12-04: Human verification of complete wizard

**Details:**
- Interactive CLI wizard with breadcrumb progress indicator
- Template auto-detection from vault folder structure
- Config.json generation with selected settings
- Claude Desktop MCP config snippet with clipboard copy
- Non-interactive mode via `--config` flag for CI/automation

---

### Phase 13: Folder Mapping & Shared Infrastructure

**Goal**: Folder-to-type mapping works consistently across CLI and Obsidian plugin with platform-agnostic paths
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: Refactor FolderMapper with glob patterns and specificity resolution
- [x] 13-02: Add tests and update Obsidian plugin to use shared FolderMapper
- [x] 13-03: Add folderMappings to TemplateDefinition and builtin templates
- [x] 13-04: Gap closure: Wire template folderMappings to CLI and Obsidian plugin

**Details:**
- Picomatch-based glob matching with weighted specificity scoring
- Async static factory pattern for extensibility
- Shared infrastructure between CLI and Obsidian plugin (no duplication)
- Template config path: template.folderMappings → Zod validation → FolderMapper

---

### Phase 14: Validate CLI

**Goal**: Users can scan their vault and understand exactly what needs fixing before making changes
**Depends on**: Phase 13 (uses folder mapping)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: Validation infrastructure (types, scanner, validator modules)
- [x] 14-02: Output formatters and CLI integration
- [x] 14-03: Unit and integration tests

**Details:**
- Discriminated union for ValidationIssue types
- Reuses VaultReader patterns for file discovery
- Grouped text output (by issue type) and JSON output (by file)
- Exit codes: 0 success, 1 validation errors, 2 config errors

---

### Phase 15: Fix CLI

**Goal**: Users can safely bulk-add frontmatter to existing markdown files with dry-run preview
**Depends on**: Phase 14 (validation patterns), Phase 13 (folder mapping)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01: Core infrastructure (types, ID generator, fixer logic)
- [x] 15-02: Writer and formatter modules
- [x] 15-03: CLI integration and tests
- [x] 15-04: Gap closure: Interactive prompting for ambiguous types

**Details:**
- ID collision algorithm: base ID, then type-prefixed, then numbered
- Atomic writes via temp file + rename pattern
- Dry-run by default, `--apply` required to modify files
- Pending resolution pattern for ambiguous folder-to-type mapping
- Folder grouping for prompts (one prompt per folder)

---

### Phase 16: Obsidian Commands

**Goal**: Users can add, validate, and fix frontmatter directly from Obsidian command palette
**Depends on**: Phase 13 (folder mapping), Phase 14 (validation logic)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 16-01: Add frontmatter command with preview modal and context menus
- [x] 16-02: Validate and Fix commands with feedback modals
- [x] 16-03: Validation sidebar panel, settings tab, folder operations
- [x] 16-04: Human verification of all commands

**Details:**
- Preview modal shows all fields before applying
- TypeSelectionModal for ambiguous folder mapping
- Inline validation logic (avoids Node fs dependencies in plugin)
- gray-matter for frontmatter parsing
- ValidationSidebarView for vault-wide overview
- Settings tab for frontmatter command behavior
- Folder context menus for bulk operations

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Dry-run default for fix command — destructive by default is anti-pattern
- @inquirer/prompts and picocolors for CLI — lightweight, well-documented
- Shared FolderMapper between CLI and plugin — no logic duplication
- Inline validation in plugin — avoid Node fs dependencies in Obsidian
- Picomatch for glob matching — already in dependency tree
- Preview modal before applying changes — user always sees what will happen

**Issues Resolved:**
- Template folderMappings wired end-to-end (config → registry → consumers)
- Ambiguous folder-to-type resolution with interactive prompting
- Platform-agnostic path handling (Windows/Unix)
- FTS5 empty query edge case (carried from v2.0)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Obsidian community plugin submission (post-v3.0)
- Hardcoded FRONTMATTER_TEMPLATES in plugin (tech debt from Phase 16)
- Template registry initialization pattern inconsistency between CLI and plugin

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Hardcoded FRONTMATTER_TEMPLATES in plugin duplicates template registry schema data
- Template registry initialization pattern differs between CLI (per-command) and plugin (on-load)
